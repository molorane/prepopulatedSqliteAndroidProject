how to incorporate Pre populated database cordova application android platform


Hello everyone, i have uploaded here, my project where i incorporated an already existing sqlite database in my cordova application for android platform. There is no where in my application where i execute a "create database" statement, why? because i already have an existing database(pre populated). i just have to use it. 

There are two things you have to do to get started. 

1. Check my MainActivity.java file how i copy a pre populated database to my device native location or "default" for my application to access it. Copy the code to your MainActivity.java

2. Check my ProjectFileStructure.png file to see where i stored my database file. The file is stored inside "assets" folder. Then from there you can begin doing what ever your want to do with your database. i hope somebody will find this useful.
